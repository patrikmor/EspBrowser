Management tool for ESP8266

This project is based on popular [a ESPlorer](https://esp8266.ru/esplorer/) made in JAVA.  
I developed this tool to simplify communication with ESP8266 board installed NodeMCU firmware.  
Tool supports downloading/uploading files from/to NodeMCU board filesystem called SPIFFS.  
Tool contains Lua scripts editor with basic functionalities like find, replace, syntax coloring for Lua keywords and simple intellisence.
